##
##  There are three basic options for calculating tropospheric delays:
##  1. Calculate Zenith delays (ZTD; Default option if nothing else is passed)
##  2. Calculate slant delays (STD) by projecting ZTD using the incidence angle:
##     STD = ZTD / cos(incidence_angle)
##  3. Calculate slant delays (STD) using raytracing:
##     STD = 1e-6 * \int_H^{Top} N(l(x,y,z)) dl
##     where H is the ground pixel elevation, "Top" is the top of the troposphere,
##     N is the refractivity (point-wise delay), and l is a ray which is traced
##     from the ground pixel to the top of the troposphere.
##
##  In addition, RAiDER supports a number of options for specifying query points,
## heights, and different weather models. Full options are listed below.

########## PARAMETERS
## Satellite look direction:
## Sentinel-1: right
## NISAR: left
look_dir: right


########## 1. Weather model
## REQUIRED: TRUE
## FORMATS: string, Select name from list below
##
## Currently implemented weather models include:
## ERA-5, ERA-5T, HRES, ERA-I, NCMR, HRRR, GMAO, MERRA-2
## See https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/blob/10686ee3f3533a33ca0788d866003c363f58fd5e/WeatherModels.md
## for more details and information on licensing
weather_model:


########## 2. Date
## REQUIRED: TRUE
## FORMATS: YYYYMMDD
##
## Dates can be a single date, two dates that define a set of dates every day, or two dates with an interval
## These will be ignored in the case that date_list is specified
date_group:
  date_start:
  date_end:
  date_step:   # date interval to download. Default is 1, i.e. every day between date_start and date_end

  ## Alternatively, you can also directly specify a comma-delimited list.
  date_list:   # e.g. [20200101, 20200201, 20200301]


########## 3. Time in UTC
## REQUIRED: TRUE
## FORMATS: HH:MM:SS; HH:MM
##
## Time is in UTC time and should be specified as HH:MM:SS or HH:MM
## The specified time should be the start time of the acquisition to within a minute
## end_time will be the end time of the acquition, if not supplied it will be assumed to be 30 seconds post start time
## For downloading weather models, RAiDER currently rounds to the nearest hour rather than interpolating
time_group:
  time:
  end_time:
  interpolate_time: True # if True will interpolate two closest times, if False will take the nearest time


########## 4. Area of Interest
## REQUIRED: FALSE
## FORMATS: string or list of floats
##
## There are several options for specifying query points
## 1. A bounding box in lat/lon specified as a space-separated list: South North West East
## 2. Specify a geocoded file, e.g. ARIA GUNW product, from which the AOI will be determined
## 3/4. lat/lon raster files (such as those produced by the ISCE software)
## 5. A comma-delimited file (station_file) containing at least the columns Lat and Lon, and optionally Hgt_m
aoi_group:
  bounding_box:
  geocoded_file:
  lat_file:
  lon_file:
  station_file:


########## 5. Height info
## REQUIRED: FALSE
## FORMATS: None, string, list of floats
##
##  Height information is used from one of the following possible sources:
##  1. (Default for bounding box) Weather model height levels (model-specific)
##  2. (Default for lat/lon points) Copernicus 30m DEM (GLO-30), downloaded on the fly
##  3. Georeferenced DEM
##    NOTE: If "use_dem_latlon" is set to true, then delays will be calculated at the DEM pixels.
##  4. Height file in radar coordinates matching lat/lon input files (Query points Option 1)
##  5. List of height levels, which will be used for all input query points
height_group:
  dem:
  use_dem_latlon: False
  height_file_rdr:
  height_levels:


########## 6. Line-of-sight or zenith calculations
## REQUIRED: FALSE
## FORMATS: string
##
## ZTD calculation: No additional inputs required
## STD calculation:
los_group:
  ray_trace: False  # Use projected slant delay by default
  zref: # Integration height. Only used in raytracing.

  # raster file in radar or geocoordinates
  los_file:
  los_convention: isce  # can be "isce" or "hyp3", see *** for details

  # NETCDF (HDF5?) file containing look vectors, see *** for details
  los_cube:

  # File containing orbit statevectors, see *** for details
  orbit_file:


########## 7. Run-time parameters
## REQUIRED: FALSE
##
runtime_group:
  verbose: True
  file_format: GTiff # Can be any rasterio-compatible format
  output_directory: . # uses the runtime directory by default
  weather_model_directory: # Defaults to <output directory>/weather_files/
  output_projection:  # Specify the PROJ-compatible projection of the output delays as an EPSG code
  cube_spacing_in_m:  # Specify the horizontal cube spacing in m (Default: 2000)
  download_only: # Only download the weather model (Default: False)
