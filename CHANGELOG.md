# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/)
and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.4]
### Changed
* [701](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/pull/701) - Fixed a few path typos and handle some edge cases, add unit tests, lint project
* [672](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/pull/672) - Linted the project with `ruff`.
* [683](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/pull/683) - Fixed a naive datetime and added default template to template generation argument
* `prepFromGunw.check_weather_model_availability` now returns `False` for HRRR when outside the CONUS or AK coverage areas, rather than raising `ValueError`.
  As a result, HRRR jobs run via HyP3 for GUNWs outside HRRR coverage will exit successfully without making any changes to the GUNW.

## [0.5.1]
### Changed
* Use hyp3-lib v3* to download orbits to be able to distribute load across ESA and ASF. Can be easily swapped out for `sentineleof` in future release.

## [0.5.0]
### Added
* A `--input-bucket-prefix` argument to `calcDelaysGUNW` which will allow RAiDER to process ARIA GUNW products under one prefix and upload the final products to another prefix provided by the `--bucket-prefix` argument.
### Fixed
* [613](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/613) - ensure NASA Earthdata credentials for downloading orbits from ASF
* [634](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/634) - download orbits from ASF before trying ESA
* [630](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/pull/630) - use correct model name so (hrrr-ak) in azimuth_timing_grid
* [620](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/620) - Fix MERRA-2 access because API was updated


## [0.4.7]
### Fixed
* [617](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/617) - RAiDER created `.netrc` is too permissive
* [622](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/617) - RAiDER's call to sentineleof needs to have missions and times have same length.

## [0.4.6]

### Added
* Added check for intermediate grid creation in _get_delays_on_cube
* Adds an `s1_orbits.py` module which includes:
  * `get_orbits_from_slc_ids` to download the associated orbit files for a list of Sentinel-1 SLC IDs
  * `ensure_orbit_credentials` to ensure ESA CSDE credentials have been provides to download orbit files. This should be called before `sentineleof` is used to download orbits.
* Adds a `setup_from_env` function to `models/credentials.py` which will pull *all* credentials needed for acquiring weather model data from environment variables and ensure the correct config file is written. This makes setting up credentials in CI pipelines significantly easier

### Changed
* `sentineleof` upgraded to version 0.9.5 or later to (a) fetch orbits from ESA CDSE and (b) ensure that if CDSE fetch fails, code resorts to ASF orbit repository

### Fixes
* RAiDER is now tested on Python version 3.9-3.12
* All typehints are now Python 3.9 compatible
* [607](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/607): Python entrypoint loading is now compatible with Python 3.12
* [610](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/610): Sentinel-1 orbit availability due to ESA migrating Sentinel-1 orbit files from Copernicus Open Access Hub (Scihub) to the new  Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE)
* make weather file directory when it doesn't exist
* Ensures the `models/data/alaska.geojson.zip` file is packaged when building from the source tarball
* Make ISCE3 an optional dependency in `s1_azimuth_timing.py`
+ Added unit tests and removed unused and depracated functions

### Removed
* `hyp3lib`, which was only used for downloading orbit fies, has been removed in favor of `sentineleof`

## [0.4.5]

### Fixes
* [#583](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/583): it appears that since the issues with geo2rdr cropped up during our processing campaign, there has been a new release of ISCE3 that resolves these failures with `geo2rdr` and the time interpolation that uses this ISCE3 routine.
* [#584](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/584): failed Raider step function in hyp3 job submission when HRRR model times are not available (even within the valid model range) - to resolve, we check availability of files when delay workflow called with a) azimuth_grid_interpolation and b) input to workflow is GUNW. If weather model files are unavailable and the GUNW is on s3, do nothing to GUNW (i.e. do not add tropo delay) and exit successfully. If weather model files are unavailable and the GUNW is on local disk, raise `ValueError`
* [#587](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/587): similar to 584 except added here to the mix is control flow in RAiDER.py passes over numerous exceptions in workflow. This is fixed identically as above.
* [#596](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/issues/596): the "prefix" for aws does not include the final netcdf file name, just the sub-directories in the bucket and therefore extra logic must be added to determine the GUNW netcdf file name (and the assocaited reference/secondary dates). We proceed by downloading the data which is needed regardless. Tests are updated.

### Removed
* Removes `update` option (either `True` or `False`) from calcGUNW workflow which asks whether the GUNW should be updated or not. In existing code, it was not being used/applied, i.e. previous workflow always updated GUNW. Removed input arguments related from respective functions so that it can be updated later.

### Added
* Allow for Hyp3 GUNW workflow with HRRR (i.e. specifying a gunw path in s3) to successfully exit if any of the HRRR model times required for `azimuth-time-grid` interpolation (which is default interpolatin method) are not available when using bucket inputs (i.e. only on the cloud)
* For GUNW workflow, when model is HRRR, azimuth_time_grid interpolation used, and using a local GUNW, if requisite weather model files are not available for  raise a ValueError (before processing)
* Raise a value error if non-unique dates are given in the function `get_inverse_weights_for_dates` in `s1_azimuth_timing.py` 
* Added metadata provenance for each delay layer that is included in GUNW and the cube workflow generally in `calcDelays` including:
   * `model_times_used` - the weather models used and interpolated for the delay calculation
   * `interpolation_method` - whether `none`, `center_time`, or `azimuth_time_grid` methods were used - see description in `calcDelayGUNW`
   * `scene_center_time` - the center time in which the associated SAR image was acquired
* Stages GMAO data for GUNW testing of correct dataset update i.e. in the test `test_GUNW_dataset_update`.
* Stages HRRR data for `test_HRRR_ztd` test.
* Ensures ISCE3 is `>=0.15.0`
* Uses correct HyP3 S3 prefix conventions and filename suffix within test patches to improve readability of what tests are mocking (see comments in #597).

### Changed
* Get only 2 or 3 model times required for azimuth-time-interpolation (previously obtained all 3 as it was easier to implement) - this ensures slightly less failures associated with HRRR availability. Importantly, if a acquisition time occurs during a model time, then we order by distance to the reference time and how early it occurs (so earlier times come first if two times are equidistant to the aquisition time).
* Made test names in `test_GUNW.py` more descriptive
* Numpy docstrings and general linting to modified function including removing variables that were not being accessed
* hrrr_download to ensure that `hybrid` coordinate is obtained regardless how herbie returns datacubes and ensures test_HRRR_ztd passes consistently
   * Remove the command line call in `test_HRRR_ztd.py` and call using the python mock up of CLI for better error handling and data mocking.
* Return xarray.Dataset types for RAiDER.calcGUNW.tropo_gunw_slc and RAiDER.raider.calcDelayGUNW for easier inspection and testing
* Fixes tests for checking availability of HRRR due Issue #596 (above).

## [0.4.4]
* For s1-azimuth-time interpolation, overlapping orbits when one orbit does not cover entire GUNW product errors out. We now ensure state-vectors are both unique and in order before creating a orbit object in ISCE3.

+ For the GUNW workflow uses azimuth time interpolation using ISCE3 geo2rdr (see [here](https://github.com/ACCESS-Cloud-Based-InSAR/s1_azimuth_time_grid)).
    - Updates `interpolate_time` options to: `'none'` (formerly `False`), `'center_time'` (formerly `True` and `default`), and `azimuth_time_grid` (not implemented previously)
+ Series of bug-fixes/compatibility updates with stats class: 
    + Inconsistent definition of index IDs, which leads to key errors as so when querying the grid space for valid data points
    + Turn off default behavior of plotting minor ticks on colorbars, which translates to unreadable plots especially when scientific notation is involved
    + Assign valid geotrans to output tif files used for replotting/dedup.
    + Properly load existing grids for replotting runs. Before the program crashed as single bands were incorrectly being read as cubes.

+ Update environment with scipy version minimum and requiring pybind11 (the latter for Apple ARM64 with rosetta2)
+ For GUNW entrypoint and associated workflow, update json metadata when bucket argument is provided to include `weather_model` key with value being a list.
   - A GUNW is downloaded from a bucket prefix with netcdf, json, and png whose name is the <GUNW_ID>. We download the json and update it to be consistent with ASF DAAC schema (link: https://github.com/asfadmin/grfn-ingest/blob/test/verify/src/metadata_schema.json)
+ For the GUNW workflow:
   - Updated GUNW workflow to expose input arguments (usually passed through command line options) within the python function for testing
   - Include integration test of HRRR for GUNW workflow
   - Test the json write (do not test s3 upload/download) in that it conforms to the DAAC ingest schema correctly - we add a weather model field to the metadata in this workflow
   - Removed comments in GUNW test suite that were left during previous development
   - If a bucket is provided and the GUNWs reference or secondary scenes are not in the valid range, we do nothing - this is to ensure that GUNWs can still be delivered to the DAAC without painful operator (i.e. person submitting to the hyp3 API) book-keeping

## [0.4.2]

### New/Updated Features
+ `prepFromGUNW` reads the date/time from the SLCs rather than the GUNW filename
+ `calcDelaysGUNW` allows processing with any supported weather model as listed in [`RAiDER.models.allowed.ALLOWED_MODELS`](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/blob/dev/tools/RAiDER/models/allowed.py).
+ Removed NCMR removed from supported model list till re-tested
+ `credentials` looks for weather model API credentials RC_file hidden file, and creates it if it does not exists
+ Isolate ISCE3 imports to only those functions that need it.
+ Small bugfixes and updates to docstrings
+ Only orbit file is used (even if multiple specified) to minimize errors and ensure consistency over region
+ GUNW packaging is restructed to store SLC (ref and sec) wet and tropo delays rather than the differential
+ padding made consistent throughout and default arguments reduced (manually update in test_losreader)

## [0.4.1]

### New/Updated Features
+ Reorder target points for intersection
+ Use exact coordinates of DEM to interpolate heights to target lat/lons
+ Support DEM interpolation to station file
+ Implement end-to-end test for intersection of cube with lat/lon files
+ Implement end-to-end test for calculation at stations delay
+ Update AOI to store the output directory so DEM is written to right place
+ `calcDelaysGUNW` will optionally download a GUNW product from AWS S3, process it, and upload a new version of the GUNW product in-place with the tropospheric correction layers added so that RAiDER can be used in ARIA GUNW production via HyP3. **Importantly**, tropospheric correction of GUNW products is still being activitely developed; this workflow, as well as the correction itself, is subject to change.

### Fixed
+ Package data is more explicitly handled so that it is included in the conda-forge build; see [#467](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/pull/467)

## [0.4.0]

Adding of new GUNW support to RAiDER. This is an interface delivery allowing for subsequent integration into HYP3 (input/output parsing is not expected to change; computed data is not yet verified).

### New/Updated Features
+ Working GUNW entry point in workflow for raider.py
+ Ability to parse a GUNW to workflows from which all required RAiDER information is extracted (e.g. dates, UTC, orbit, bbox, look direction, wavelength) with an option to specify weather model (those already supported by RAiDER) and ability to squeeze in the derived output into the original GUNW product.
+ Delays for GUNW are calculated in RAiDER using the ray-tracing option specifying bbox (GUNW driven), a hardcoded lateral posting (0.05º for HRRR and 0.1º for others),  fixed vertical height levels, using an different orbit file for  secondary and master.
     - The hard-coded heights and posting will be refined per model and to ensure stitching abilities in ARIA-tools.
     - The orbit should be refined to not change between secondary and reference to avoid issues. See https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER/discussions/435#discussioncomment-4392665
+ Bug fix for raider.py "date" input argument when multiple dates are requested (i.e. support of requesting two dates or two dates with a sampling).
+ Add unit test for date input argument checking (single day, two dates, two dates with samples)
+ Write the diagnostic weather model files to the 'output_directory' rather than PWD
+ Fix for incorrectly written hard-cored projection embedded in the computed output data
+ Allow for multiple orbits files/dates to be used for slant:projection
+ correctly pass llh to lla_to_ecef function for slant:projection
    ++ verified this doesnt change anything
+ removed deprecated ray projection functionality
+ added 1º buffer for zenith and projected (already done for ray tracing)
+ differential delay is rounded to model-dependent nearest hour
+ version 1c hardcoded into the updated GUNW

### Added dependencies for:
+ sentinelof: used to fetch the orbit for GUNW
+ rioxarray: used for reading rasters with xarray

### Not implemented / supported in this release### Not implemented / supported in this release
+ no temporal interpolation
+ no refined model specific hardcoded spacing and heights
+ no ability for single orbit Interferometric calculation
+ no verification of results
