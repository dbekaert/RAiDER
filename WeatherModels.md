# Accessing weather model data
RAiDER has built-in support for a number of different weather models. In addition, RAiDER provides functionality for adding additional weather models as users have need. RAiDER provides all of the interfacing to data servers required to access data for the different weather models, although some weather models require a license agreement. Instructions for accessing data, including license-limited data, are provided below. It is the user's responsibility to accept license agreements for whatever model is desired. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<b>Potential download failure:</b> 
ERA-5/ERA-I products require access to the ESA Copernicus servers. GMAO and MERRA-2 products require access to the NASA Earthdata servers. If you are unable to download products, ensure that you have registered and have downloaded the public API key, and accepted/added the license/application for type of product you wish to download as detailed below.

## Open-source models (HRRR)
1. High-resolution rapid refresh (HRRR) weather model data products are generated by __[NOAA](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/)__ for the coninental US (CONUS) but not archived beyond three days. However a public __[archive](home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/hrrr_FAQ.html)__ is available at the University of Utah. This archive does not require a license agreement. This model has the highest spatial resolution available in RAiDER, with a horizontal grid spacing of about 3 km, and is provided in a Lambert conformal conic projection. 

## ECMWF weather models (ERA-5, ERA-5T, ERA-I, HiRES)
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (__[ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/)__) provides a number of different weather models, including both reanalysis and real-time models. You can read more information about their reanalysis models __[here](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis)__ and real-time model __[here](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/catalogue-ecmwf-real-time-products)__. ECMWF models are global, with horizontal resolution of about 30 km for ERA-I, ERA-5, and ERA-5T, and 6 km for Hi-RES. All of these models come in a global projection (EPSG 4326, WGS-84). 

ECMWF requires a license agreement to be able to access, download, and use their products. Instructions for completing this process is below. 

### Accessing ERA-5 and ERA-5T weather reanalysis products
1. Create an account on the Copernicus servers __[here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user)__
2. Confirm your email, etc. 
3. Install the public API key and client as instructed __[here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to)__:
   
   a. Copy the URL and API key from the webpage into a file in your home directory name ~/.cdsapirc 
         url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2
         key: your_key_here
      __**Note**: the key represents the API key obtained upon the registration of CDS API, and should be replaced with the user's own information.__

   b. Install the CDS API using pip: 
         pip install cdsapi
   ___**Note**: this step has been included in the conda install of RAiDER, thus can be omitted if one uses the recommended conda install of RAiDER___
4. You must accept the [license](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp/#!/terms/licence-to-use-copernicus-products) for each product you wish to download.

### Accessing ERA-I, Hi-RES

1. Create an account on the Copernicus-ECMWF servers __[here](https://accounts.ecmwf.int/auth/realms/ecmwf/protocol/openid-connect/auth?response_type=code&scope=openid%20email&client_id=apache-www&state=sBYlpcTRPhat8d6uuM9swLCxuP8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecmwf.int%2Foidc.cgi&nonce=RyEzBUy4m6oo_HxRQEmJxbc5jrKY4KFZd1Usgi8cpnM)__
2. Confirm your email, etc. 
3. Install the public API key and client as instructed __[here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets#AccessECMWFPublicDatasets-key)__: 
    
    a. Copy the URL and API key from the webpage into a file in your home directory name ~/.cdsapirc 
        url: "https://api.ecmwf.int/v1"
        email: your_email_here
        key: your_key_here
    __**Note**: the email that is used to register the user account, and the key represents the API key obtained upon the registration of ECMWF API, and should be replaced with the user's own information.__

    b. Install the ECMWF API using pip: 
        ```pip install ecmwf-api-client```
    ___**Note**: this step has been included in the conda install of RAiDER, thus can be omitted if one uses the recommended conda install of RAiDER___


### Accessing NASA weather models (GMAO, MERRA-2)
    
1. The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (__[GMAO](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/coupled-products/geos5-forecast#:~:text=The%20Global%20Modeling%20and%20Assimilation,near%2Dreal%2Dtime%20production.)__) at NASA generates reanalysis weather models. GMAO products can also be accessed without a license agreement through the pyDAP interface implemented in RAiDER. GMAO has a horizontal grid spacing of approximately 33 km, and its projection is EPSG code 4326 (WGS-84). 

2. The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (__[MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/#:~:text=MERRA%2D2%20is%20the%20first,(say)%20Greenland%20and%20Antarctica.)__) provides data beginning in 1980. MERRA-2 is also produced by NASA and has a spatial resolution of about 50 km and a global projection (EPSG 4326, WGS-84).

### Accessing NASA weather model data
1. Create an account on the NASA's Earthdata website [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov)
2. Confirm your email, etc. 
3. Copy the login username and password to a file in your home directory name ~/.netrc 
         
         machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
                 login <USERNAME>
                 password <PASSWORD>
                 
   __**Note**: the username and password represent the user's username and password.__
   
4. Add the application `NASA GESDISC DATA ARCHIVE` by clicking on the `Applications->Authorized Apps` on the menu after logging into your Earthdata profile, and then scrolling down to the application `NASA GESDISC DATA ARCHIVE` to approve it. _This seems not required for GMAO for now, but recommended to do so for all OpenDAP-based weather models._
5. Install the OpenDAP using pip: 

         pip install pydap==3.2.1
      

   ___**Note**: this step has been included in the conda install of RAiDER, thus can be omitted if one uses the recommended conda install of RAiDER___
   
   ___**Note**: PyDAP v3.2.1 is required for now (thus specified in the above pip install command) because the latest v3.2.2 (as of now) has a known [bug](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f_ss1Oa3VzgAOd_p8sgekdnLVE5NW6s5) in accessing and slicing the GMAO data. This bug is expected to be fixed in newer versions of PyDAP.___
